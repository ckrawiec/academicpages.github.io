'We present a programmatic study of physicists’ and astronomers’ attitudes toward education and public outreach (EPO) using 131 survey responses from members of the Dark Energy Survey. We find a disparity between the types of EPO activities researchers deem valuable and those in which they participate. Most respondents are motivated to engage in EPO by a desire to educate the public. Barriers to engagement include career- and skill-related concerns, but lack of time is the main deterrent. We explore the value of centralized EPO efforts and conclude with a list of recommendations for increasing researchers’ engagement.'
