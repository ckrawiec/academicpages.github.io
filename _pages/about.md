Dark Energy Survey (DES)
======
[DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) is a 5,000 sq. deg. optical imaging survey seeking to uncover the exact nature of the ``dark energy'' driving the accelerated expansion of our universe. 
I worked with DES during my Ph.D. tenure from  2014-2018 on various weak lensing and outreach projects. My thesis work revolved around selecting high redshift galaxies in the DES Science Verification data and measuring their lensing magnification around foreground red galaxies.
