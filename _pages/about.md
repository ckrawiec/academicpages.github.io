Coding
======
I regularly write scripts in Python for my own plotting and data analysis. I have also worked on a major project in C++. I am also familiar with IDL, R, Java, SQL, and Fortran.

Check out my [Github repositories](https://github.com/ckrawiec) to see what I'm working on.

University of Pennsylvania Physics & Astronomy
======
I have been a student at UPenn since 2013, becoming a Ph.D. candidate in 2016. I work with Professor Gary M. Bernstein studing weak gravitational lensing with the Dark Energy Survey.


Dark Energy Survey (DES)
======
[DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) is a 5,000 sq. deg. optical imaging survey seeking to uncover the exact nature of the ``dark energy'' driving the accelerated expansion of our universe.
