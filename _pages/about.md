Please see my full work/research history [here](ckrawiec.github.io/files/CV0518.pdf).


Coding
======
I regularly write scripts in Python for my own plotting and data analysis. I have also worked on a major project in C++. I am also familiar with IDL, R, Java, SQL, and Fortran.

Check out my [Github repositories](https://github.com/ckrawiec) to see what I'm working on.

University of Pennsylvania Physics & Astronomy
======
I have been a student at UPenn since 2013, becoming a Ph.D. candidate in 2016. I work with Professor Gary M. Bernstein studing weak gravitational lensing with the Dark Energy Survey.


Dark Energy Survey (DES)
======
[DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) is a 5,000 sq. deg. optical imaging survey seeking to uncover the exact nature of the ``dark energy'' driving the accelerated expansion of our universe. 
I have been working with DES since 2014 on various weak lensing projects. My thesis work revolves around selecting high redshift galaxies in the DES Science Verification data and measuring their lensing magnification around foreground red galaxies.
