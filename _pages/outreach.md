Penn Education and Public Outreach in Physics and Astronomy (PEPOPA)
======
I, along with several Penn graduate students, started a GAPSA-funded outreach group in the Physics & Astronomy department in 2016. We organize events and demonstrations aimed at teached the public about our research and physics in general. 

As part of this group, I have held two titles: Social Media Manager & Science After Hours Liaison. As the former, I have posted updates and articles to the @pennphys pages on Facebook and Twitter since PEPOPA's inception. As the latter, I have led our department's involvement in the Franklin Institute's monthly adult night called ``Science After Hours," where we bring demonstrations of various physical principles that relate to the night's theme.

Dark Energy Survey (DES) Education and Public Outreach (EPO)
======
[DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) is a 5,000 sq. deg. optical imaging survey seeking to uncover the exact nature of the ``dark energy'' driving the accelerated expansion of our universe. 
I have been working with DES since 2014 on various weak lensing projects, but have also been involved as a volunteer in the EPO group since 2015. We are a small contingent of scientists in the collaboration who love telling the world about DES science. We receive no funding for this work, but keep the website and social media active for the survey. 

As of this summer (2018) I am an EPO Coordinator for DES, and manage the website and YouTube channels.
