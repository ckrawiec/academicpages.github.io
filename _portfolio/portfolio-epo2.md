Data obtained by Google Form Survey ([view its content here](https://ckrawiec.github.io/files/wolf_supplemental.pdf')). To read out complete analysis, please view our [full article](https://www.jstemoutreach.org/article/8981-astronomers-and-physicists-attitudes-toward-education-and-public-outreach-a-programmatic-study-of-the-dark-energy-survey) in the Journal of STEM Outreach. 

The following figure compares the actual engagement and perceived value of nineteen different EPO (Education & Public Outreach) activities according to 131 survey respondents from the Dark Energy Survey - an international collaboration of astronomers and physicists imaging the southern sky. Respondents were presented with the activities and asked 1) if they have ever engaged in the activity and 2) to rank its value (level of impact). The number of counted responses, n, is noted in white (out of a total of 131).

“Value of Activity” is calculated using the following metric for each activity:

Here Ri  is  the  rank  from  0-5  (Not  Impactful  responses  were  counted  as  0),  nresp  is  the  total  number  of  responses,  and nIDK is  the  number  of "I Don’t  Know"  responses  (which  are excluded from the sum).

In addition, we gathered the following data on time commitment to EPO, presented in table format:
